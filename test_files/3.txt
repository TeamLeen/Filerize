Question 1 This question is about Logic and Set Theory.
a) Use a truth table to prove that (P ∨ ¬R) ⇔ (Q ⇒ ⊥) is equivalent to
(P ⇒ ¬Q) ∧ (Q ⇒ R) ∧ (R ⇒ (¬Q ⇒ P )). [6 marks]
As long as the columns for both relevant formulas are present and
clearly marked, it is a valid truth table. So you will get full marks as
long as the columns for (P ∨ ¬R) ⇔ (Q ⇒ ⊥) and (P ⇒ ¬Q) ∧ (Q ⇒
R) ∧ (R ⇒ (¬Q ⇒ P )) match the ones provided below. Correct an-
swers may have more (e.g. splitting R ⇒ (¬Q ⇒ P ) into R and
¬Q ⇒ P ) or less columns than the answer I provide below.

b) Let A = {a, b, 1, 2}, B = {a, b, c} and C = {1, 2, 3}.
(i) What is the powerset of A ∩ B?
Since A ∩ B = {a, b}, its powerset is: {∅, {a}, {b}, {a, b}}.
(ii) Draw an Euler diagram of A, B and C.
See below. The Euler diagram need not be rectangular, but may
only have the 4 areas displayed.
(iii) Draw a Venn diagram of A, B and C.
(iv) Let D = P(A \ B) × C. What is |D|?
|D| = |P(A \ B)| · |C| = 4 · 3 = 12.
(v) Using A, B, C, and the basic set operations (∪, ∩, \, P, ×) con-
struct {(c, 3)}.
(B \ A) × (C \ A). [Or: (B × C) \ ((A × (A ∪ C)) ∪ ((A ∪ B) × A
